# BUILD PROGRESS — bakeri-demo

> **Purpose:** authoritative running log of every change made to this prototype, tied to a git commit. Any future agent or collaborator picking up this repo should be able to read this top-to-bottom and know exactly what state the build is in, why each decision was made, and how to revert.
>
> **Rules for keeping this file healthy:**
> 1. Append a new entry for every commit. Never edit a past entry except to fix typos.
> 2. The `Commit` field is filled in **after** the commit lands (by reading `git rev-parse HEAD`).
> 3. Always describe **what changed**, **why** (referencing the customer / spec / review feedback), and **how to revert** (which file ranges were affected).
> 4. Update `## Current state of each tier` at the bottom whenever a tier-level rule changes (e.g. "classic now has no animations", "premium now has X feature").

## Project context

- **Brand inside the prototype:** Møller Bakeri (Bergen, fictional family bakery, est. 1962)
- **Customer category:** small Norwegian bakery — generic enough to fork into any real bakery customer
- **Architecture verdict:** vanilla HTML + CSS + JS (per `_docs/_skill/ARCHITECTURE-DECISION-GUIDE.md`)
- **Two tiers ship together:**
  - `demo-bakeri-classic/` — ~9999 NOK target price, simple static marketing site
  - `demo-bakeri-premium/` — ~17000–19000 NOK target price, classic + signature interactive features
- **Locked across both tiers (per family rules):**
  - Vipps demo modal phrase (NO): *"Dette er en demo — Vipps-betaling aktiveres når din konto er satt opp."*
  - Footer credit: *"Utviklet av Bithun"* (NO) / *"Developed by Bithun"* (EN where applicable)
  - Real `favicon.svg` (wheat-stalk glyph)
  - Vercel Web Analytics snippet on every page
- **Locked premium-only signature features:**
  1. Daily-bake live counter (animated count-up, time-of-day aware)
  2. Sourdough timeline (5-step, highlights current stage by hour-of-day)
  3. Animated croissant-icon dividers
  4. Animated hero (MP4 video with JPG poster fallback)

## Change log (newest at bottom — append, do not reorder)

### Commit `19caacc` — Initial scaffold + images + hero video
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** initial commit
- **What:** First commit of the prototype repo. Captures everything built across the prior conversation:
  - `demo-bakeri-classic/` — 5 HTML pages (index, menu, about, gallery, 404), single `css/style.css`, single `js/main.js`, favicon, full asset set (48 image files including renamed copies for the menu and gallery slots)
  - `demo-bakeri-premium/` — fork of classic + 3 signature features (live bake counter, sourdough timeline, animated croissant dividers) + hero video element + premium-only CSS/JS extensions. 49 image files + `assets/videos/hero-bread.mp4`
  - `.claude/Nano-Banana-prompt.md` — image generation prompts (gitignored — internal)
  - `.claude/BUILD_PROGRESS.md` — this log (tracked)
  - `.gitignore` — ignores `.claude/*` except `BUILD_PROGRESS.md`
- **Why:** baseline before customer-style review and refinement. Lets every subsequent change be auditable.
- **How to revert:** `git reset --hard <this commit>` resets to the exact "as-shipped after Nano Banana run" state.

### Commit `b65ed85` — Comment out visitor-badge in classic
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** chore
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-classic/index.html`, `menu.html`, `about.html`, `gallery.html` (4 files)
- **What:** Wrapped the `<img>` element that renders the laobi.icu visitor-badge inside an HTML comment in all 4 footer instances. URL string preserved. 404.html had no badge to begin with.
- **Why:** Review feedback — page-view counter is a premium-tier feature; classic should not display it. Customer can pay to upgrade and re-enable.
- **How to revert:** `git revert b65ed85`, or hand-uncomment the 4 `<!-- ... -->` blocks (search for "Visitor badge — premium-only feature").

### Commit `725314e` — Comment out i18n + EN toggle in classic
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** chore
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-classic/{index,menu,about,gallery,404}.html`, `js/main.js` (6 files)
- **What:**
  - HTML: lang-toggle and mobile-lang-toggle `<button>`s wrapped in HTML comments in all 5 pages.
  - JS: the entire i18n block (`translations` object + `t/applyTranslations/toggleLanguage/initLangToggle` functions) wrapped in a single `/* ... */` block comment. The two corresponding init calls in `DOMContentLoaded` line-commented.
  - All translation strings preserved verbatim — re-enable is a no-rewrite job.
- **Why:** Review feedback — classic ships Norwegian-only; bilingual is a paid premium upsell. Static Norwegian copy already lives in the HTML elements, so the visible site is unchanged for Norwegian users.
- **How to revert:** `git revert 725314e`. Or hand-revert: remove the wrapping `/* */` in main.js (1 opener, 1 closer), uncomment the two `DOMContentLoaded` calls, uncomment the EN toggle buttons in each HTML file.

### Commit `28a295e` — Strip animations from classic (static-website spec)
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** feat
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-classic/css/style.css`, `js/main.js`
- **What:**
  - CSS: appended a CLASSIC STATIC OVERRIDE block to end of style.css that:
    - kills every transition + animation via universal `*, *::before, *::after`
    - forces `.reveal` and `.reveal-stagger` children visible
    - disables hover lifts, image scale-ups, button shadow intensify
    - keeps base shadows and palette intact
    - disables nav.scrolled box-shadow change
  - JS: in `DOMContentLoaded`, line-commented `initScrollAnimations()` and the `page-fade` class application.
- **Why:** Review feedback — classic must read like a fully static website. No card lifts, no fade-ups, no page fade, no hover transforms.
- **How to revert:** `git revert 28a295e`. The override block is a single contiguous region at end-of-file; deleting it alone restores full motion. JS calls just need uncommenting.

### Commit `aea58ef` — Redesign classic mobile menu (compact dropdown)
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** feat
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-classic/css/style.css`, `js/main.js`
- **What:**
  - CSS: appended a CLASSIC MOBILE MENU REDESIGN block (after the static override). Inside `@media (max-width: 768px)`, replaces the full-screen overlay with a 240px-wide right-anchored dropdown card under the nav: white card, body-font links, hairline row dividers, soft drop shadow.
  - JS: rewrote the hamburger handler in `initNav()`:
    - dropped `document.body.style.overflow` lock (compact menu doesn't need it)
    - close on click-outside (event-bubbling-aware via stopPropagation on hamburger)
    - close on Escape key
    - kept close-on-link-click
- **Why:** Review feedback — old full-screen overlay with large centered serif links was disorienting. Static site needs an unobtrusive native-feeling dropdown.
- **How to revert:** `git revert aea58ef`. Or delete the CLASSIC MOBILE MENU REDESIGN block in CSS and restore the original `if (hamburger && mobileMenu)` body in JS.

### Commit `41f83ae` — Redesign premium mobile menu (320px liquid-glass)
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** feat
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-premium/css/style.css`, `js/main.js`
- **What:**
  - CSS: appended a PREMIUM MOBILE MENU block at end-of-file. Inside `@media (max-width: 768px)`:
    - 320px-wide (capped at 86vw), full-height under the 72px nav, anchored right
    - background `rgba(251,246,236,0.55)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(160%)` — liquid-glass tint
    - 1px warm-gold (rgba(225,190,130,0.35)) left border, `-12px 0 40px` brown shadow
    - slides in with `transform: translateX(100%) → translateX(0)`, `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0.16, 1)` 0.42s spring
    - body-font links 1.05rem with soft warm-gold row dividers
    - lang-toggle (still present in premium) restyled to match glass aesthetic
  - JS: rewrote hamburger handler symmetrically with classic — close on outside-click / Escape / link-click, no body scroll lock. Lang-toggle clicks do not close the panel by design.
- **Why:** Spec — premium mobile menu must be 320px liquid-glass, transparent, partial-viewport. Visually distinct from classic.
- **How to revert:** `git revert 41f83ae`. Or delete the PREMIUM MOBILE MENU block in CSS and restore the original `if (hamburger && mobileMenu)` body in JS.

### Commit `8652231` — Dedupe menu + gallery images (review round 2)
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** fix(content)
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-classic/{menu,gallery}.html`, `demo-bakeri-premium/{menu,gallery}.html`, `.claude/Nano-Banana-prompt.md`, plus 60 image deletions (30 per tier)
- **What:**
  - All 18 menu-item `<img>` `src=` attributes in each tier's `menu.html` now reference the 15 unique source filenames directly (no more `menu-sourdough-N.jpg` indirection). 3 wide-banner shots (`banner-menu`, `banner-about`, `banner-gallery`) re-used at most twice each, in non-adjacent items across different sections — no other source appears more than once in the menu.
  - All 12 gallery-item `<img>` `src=` attributes in each tier's `gallery.html` now reference 12 unique source filenames. `cat-cake.jpg` (the strawberry cake) and `hero-bread.jpg` each appear exactly once where they previously appeared twice.
  - Deleted 30 orphan rename-copies from each tier's `assets/images/` (`menu-sourdough-1..6.jpg`, `menu-pastry-1..6.jpg`, `menu-cake-1..6.jpg`, `gallery-1..12.jpg`).
  - `Nano-Banana-prompt.md`: rewrote the "Reuse note" to document the new direct-reference approach.
- **Why:** Review feedback round 2 — same image was used 3-4× across menu items at different prices, and `cat-cake` plus `hero-bread` each appeared twice in the gallery. User asked for variety.
- **How to revert:** `git revert 8652231` restores all `menu-*-N.jpg` and `gallery-N.jpg` references AND re-creates the deleted copies (since the commit recorded their deletion).

### Commit `ccb54bc` — Face-friendly cropping on mobile
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** fix(css)
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-classic/css/style.css`, `demo-bakeri-premium/css/style.css`
- **What:** Both tiers gain a FACE-FRIENDLY CROPPING block at end of style.css:
  - `.menu-item-image`, `.bake-card-image`, `.category-card img` get `object-position: center 30%` so portraits with people (Anna at the ovens, Selma shaping pastries, Anna+Lars at the counter) keep their faces in the safe area when these containers crop with `object-fit: cover`.
  - `@media (max-width: 768px)` `.gallery-item img`: `aspect-ratio: 4/5; object-fit: cover; object-position: center 30%`. Forces a uniform portrait-leaning crop on mobile so the masonry doesn't render extreme-tall items in single column. Desktop layout unchanged.
- **Why:** Review feedback round 2 — faces clipped on the mobile gallery / cards.
- **How to revert:** `git revert ccb54bc` or delete the FACE-FRIENDLY CROPPING block from each style.css.

### Commit `f7bc7a7` — Premium mobile menu shrunk to floating glass card
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** feat(premium)
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-premium/css/style.css`
- **What:** The previous 320px-wide full-height side panel (commit `41f83ae`) was too big. Replaced its rule block with a compact floating glass card:
  - `top: 88px; right: 1rem` — floats 16px below the nav bar, anchored to the right edge with margin
  - `width: 320px; height: auto` — only as tall as its content (~5 rows + lang toggle)
  - `border-radius: 18px` (rounded corners), `1px solid rgba(225,190,130,0.4)` warm-gold border, `0 16px 40px` brown shadow
  - `rgba(251,246,236,0.62)` background with `backdrop-filter: blur(22px) saturate(170%)` (kept glass effect)
  - opens with `transform: translateY(-8px) scale(0.97) → 0/1` and `opacity 0 → 1`, cubic-bezier spring
  - lang-toggle + link styling carried over from previous design
- **Why:** Review feedback round 2 — premium hamburger menu was too big; user requested a small 320px rounded glass card like the classic dropdown but with the glass effect kept.
- **How to revert:** `git revert f7bc7a7` restores the full-height side-panel block.

### Commit `be32404` — Reposition hero/gallery crops + remap 11 wrong menu images
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** fix(images)
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/css/style.css`, `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/{index,menu,gallery}.html` (8 files). `Nano-Banana-prompt.md` updated (gitignored).
- **What:**
  - CSS (both tiers): `.hero-bg` mobile background-position `50%→65%` so bread subject (right of centre in hero-bread.jpg) no longer clips on narrow screens.
  - CSS premium: `.hero-video` mobile `object-position: 65% 50%` override added.
  - CSS (both tiers): default `object-position` for `.menu-item-image`, `.bake-card-image`, `.category-card img` changed from `center 30%` (face-biased) to `center 50%` (neutral) since most slots now hold food shots, not face photos.
  - CSS (both tiers): added 4 focal-point utility classes (`.focal-lower`, `.focal-low`, `.focal-right`, `.bg-focal-right`) with `!important` to allow per-image overrides without inline styles.
  - HTML index.html (both): `cat-sourdough.jpg` category card → `class="focal-lower"` (55%); `cat-cake.jpg` → `class="focal-low"` (70%).
  - HTML menu.html (both): `cat-sourdough` sour3 → `focal-lower`; `cat-pastry` past2 (mandelcroissant) → `focal-lower`; `cat-cake` cake1 (bløtkake) → `focal-low`. 11 wrong image srcs replaced: sour4→`menu-01-olive-rosemary`, sour5→`menu-02-buckwheat`, sour6→`menu-03-roll`, past3→`menu-04-pain-chocolat`, past4→`menu-05-kanelsnurr`, past6→`menu-06-eplekrans`, cake2→`menu-07-truffle-cake`, cake3→`menu-08-lemon-pistasj`, cake4→`menu-09-bringebær`, cake5→`menu-10-brownie`, cake6→`menu-11-lemon-tart`.
  - HTML gallery.html (both): gallery item 8 (hero-bread.jpg) → `class="focal-right"` (65% horizontal).
  - HTML premium gallery.html: page-banner-bg → `class="bg-focal-right"` to shift banner-gallery.jpg left.
  - Nano-Banana-prompt.md: all 18 existing image headers numbered [01]–[18] + [V01] for video; 11 new prompts [19]–[29] added for the new menu-NN filenames.
- **Why:** Review round 3 — hero image cropped from right on mobile; multiple menu items showed bakery counters / person portraits / mill machinery instead of the food item; category/menu card focal points were top-biased (30%) causing white background and wall to dominate over bread/cake.
- **How to revert:** `git revert be32404`. Nano-Banana-prompt.md changes are manual only (gitignored).

### Commits `8937220` — Wire 11 new food images — menu + gallery
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** feat(content)
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/menu.html`, `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/gallery.html`, 22 new `.jpeg` image assets
- **What:**
  - Fixed all 11 new menu image extensions from `.jpg` → `.jpeg` (Nano Banana exports JPEG format)
  - Added 11 new gallery items (img13–img23) to both gallery pages with Norwegian captions: Olive & Rosmarin Surdeig, Glutenfri Bokhvete, Pølse-rull, Pain au Chocolat, Kanelsnurr, Eplekrans, Sjokolade-trøffelkake, Sitron-pistasjekake, Bringebær-mandelfirkant, Sjokoladebrownie med havsalt, Sitronpai
  - Committed 22 new `.jpeg` assets to git (11 per tier)
- **Why:** 11 new food photos (menu-01 through menu-11) generated in Nano Banana by Bithun were placed in both asset folders. HTML referenced `.jpg` but files landed as `.jpeg`. Gallery needed the new shots added.
- **How to revert:** `git revert 8937220` removes all 22 image files and reverts the 4 HTML files.

### Commit `a2ca9b9` + `94a4a83` — focal-upper class for Smørcroissant
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** fix(crop)
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/css/style.css`, `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/menu.html`
- **What:**
  - Added `.focal-upper { object-position: center 10% !important; }` utility class to both stylesheets
  - Applied `class="focal-upper"` to `today-croissant.jpg` in both menu.html files
  - Initial value was `center 25%` (commit `a2ca9b9`), tightened to `center 10%` after screenshot review showed the back croissant crust still clipping (commit `94a4a83`)
- **Why:** Review round 3 — Smørcroissant image cropped from the top on mobile; back croissant's crust tips were cut off.
- **How to revert:** `git revert 94a4a83 a2ca9b9` (in that order) or delete `.focal-upper` from both stylesheets and the class from both menu files.

### Commit `d22c853` — Premium gallery grayscale-to-color + floating cards
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** feat(premium)
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-premium/css/style.css`, `demo-bakeri-premium/js/main.js`
- **What:**
  - **Gallery (premium only):** All `.gallery-item img` now default to `filter: grayscale(100%)`. On hover/touch they reveal full colour with `filter: grayscale(0%)` + `transform: scale(1.04)`. Touch support via `.active` class toggled by `touchstart` in `initGallery()`. `::after` overlay changes from a dark tint to a `2px solid var(--color-accent-light)` border highlight on hover/active.
  - **Floating cards (premium only):** `@keyframes card-float` uses pure `translateY` only (no `rotate` — avoids Paint repaints, confirmed by IDE linter hints). `.bake-card:nth-child(1/2/3)` animate at 4.2s / 5.1s / 3.8s with 0.9s / 1.0s / 1.1s positive delays (delays cover the 0.6s reveal transition). `.categories-grid .category-card:nth-child(1/2/3)` animate at 4.7s / 5.5s / 4.1s with 1.2s / 1.4s / 1.6s delays. Staggered durations + start phases prevent cards syncing.
  - Removed `transform: translateY(-4px)` from `.bake-card:hover` and `.category-card:hover` (animation owns `transform`; kept `box-shadow` lift on hover instead).
  - Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { .bake-card, .category-card { animation: none; } }` fallback.
- **Why:** User request — inspired by fiskeier-demo premium About section (grayscale → color on hover). Floating cards requested as "random alive feel" for the Dagens bakst and Vårt utvalg sections.
- **Gotcha fixed:** IDE linter warned that `rotate()` inside `@keyframes` triggers Paint (not just Composite). Stripped `rotate()` from all keyframe steps — pure `translateY` is GPU-composited only.
- **How to revert:** `git revert d22c853`. Restores the old gallery saturate hover, old card hover transform, and removes float animation.

### Commit `c2fd7c8` — Review-round-4: parity, polish, animation pause-on-hover
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** feat
- **Files touched:** 16 files across both tiers (HTML, CSS, JS, favicon, .gitignore)
- **What (CLASSIC):**
  - Restructured gallery into the same 3 explicit `.gallery-col` wrappers as premium (8 / 7 / 8 split, items distributed by `nth-child` modulo 3 for visual variety). `display: flex` replaces `columns: 3` multi-column.
  - Added comprehensive `:hover`-killer block at end of CSS — flips menu cards, FAQ buttons, nav links, footer links, buttons, mobile-menu rows, lang-toggle, modal close, and image-scale hovers all back to base appearance. The earlier `* { transition: none }` rule killed *animation* of hover changes; this block kills the *end-state* changes too.
  - About photo grid: `grid-template-rows: 230px / 230px / 540px`, default `object-position: center 28%` to keep faces in frame, storefront tile uses `object-fit: contain` so the whole 16:9 building shows (slight letterboxing absorbs the source ratio mismatch).
  - Added 4th category card on the homepage (Kafé & disk → about-photo-2.jpg). Heading changed to "Alt under samme tak". Grid now 4-col desktop / 2-col tablet / 1-col mobile.
  - Synced inline body copy with the longer premium JS translations: `today1/2/3.text`, `story.p1/p2`, `about.story.p1/p2`, `menu.sour.intro`. Both tiers now read identically in shared sections.
  - Favicon: rounded cream tile (`#FBF6EC`) wraps the wheat glyph so it's legible on dark browser tabs.
  - Gallery banner: `bg-focal-right` class added so framing matches premium.
- **What (PREMIUM):**
  - Fixed `og:image` URL (was pointing at `demo-bakeri-classic.vercel.app`). Added `og:url`.
  - Nav hover: replaced underline with per-link colored text-shadow glow. Tones: `#B8842B` (Home) / `#C8704F` (Meny) / `#D4A24A` (Om oss) / `#A8454F` (Galleri) — all warm bakery palette, no cool outliers (replaced the original sage-green that read as out-of-place).
  - rameezscripts pause-on-hover pattern for all floating cards (`.bake-card`, `.category-card`, `.menu-grid .menu-item`): `:hover { animation-play-state: paused !important; }` PLUS a back-side amber ring (`box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px ...`, 38px blur). Critical detail: the `:hover` rule must come **after** the `:nth-child` float-shorthand rules in source order, otherwise the shorthand resets `animation-play-state` to `running`.
  - Sourdough timeline: per-icon `step-icon-float` keyframe, 5 different durations (4.0s–5.2s) and delays (0.2s–1.4s) so step icons bob independently from the active-step ring pulse.
  - Mobile menu redesign: 240px wide (was 320px), `rgba(251,246,236,0.40)` background with `blur(30px) saturate(180%)` backdrop filter, inset highlight on top edge for genuine liquid-glass feel. Tighter padding.
  - Gallery: restructured into 3 explicit `.gallery-col` wrappers (8 / 7 / 8 split). Each column animates: col 1 drifts down, col 2 up, col 3 down (`gallery-drift-down/up` keyframes, 9 s, staggered delays). `columns: unset` overrides the original multi-column rule. Mobile collapses to single column with animation off.
  - Added 4th category card (same content as classic — parity).
  - Fixed `'baker hver kveld natt'` typo in `story.p2` (NO) — now `'baker hver natt'`.
  - About photo grid: same restructure as classic; storefront tile uses `object-fit: contain` (no crop).
  - Inline HTML synced with JS translations so SEO crawlers and no-JS users see the rich copy.
- **Why:** Customer-style review round 4 — long list of cosmetic and parity asks: identical menu/text/colors across tiers, classic must read static, premium gets richer interactions, About-page collage redo, gallery balance, glassier mobile menu, rameezscripts-inspired pause-on-hover pattern.
- **Gotcha fixed:** Original menu pause-on-hover wasn't working because the `:nth-child` `animation:` shorthand later in the file was resetting `animation-play-state` back to `running`. Solved by reordering source so `:hover` comes after `:nth-child`, plus `!important` for safety.
- **How to revert:** `git revert c2fd7c8`. Big diff — easier to revert the whole commit than to hand-roll. The classic `:hover`-killer block can be dropped on its own (search for "CLASSIC — KILL ALL :hover STATE CHANGES") to restore classic's old hover-state-without-transitions behaviour.

### Commit `d410981` — Deploy: vercel.json, robots, sitemap, canonical og URLs
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** chore
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/{vercel.json,robots.txt,sitemap.xml,index.html}` (8 files)
- **What:**
  - `vercel.json` per tier: `/assets/*` → `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; `*.css/*.js` → `max-age=86400, must-revalidate`; security headers on all routes (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN, Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin, Permissions-Policy locking camera/mic/geolocation, HSTS 1y includeSubDomains).
  - `robots.txt` per tier: initially `Allow: /` + sitemap pointer (later changed — see next commit).
  - `sitemap.xml` per tier: 4 URLs (later removed — see next commit).
  - `og:image` and new `og:url` on both `index.html` files now use the canonical `*.ibithun.com` custom domain instead of the auto-generated `*.vercel.app` preview URL.
- **Why:** Sites went live on `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}.ibithun.com`. Vercel doesn't require `vercel.json` for static sites but the custom cache + security headers are deploy hygiene.
- **How to revert:** `git revert d410981`. Falls back to Vercel's default cache + bare HTTP headers.

### Commit `<pending>` — Demo: noindex / nofollow, drop sitemap
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** chore
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/{robots.txt,index.html,menu.html,about.html,gallery.html,404.html}` (12 files), removed `sitemap.xml` from both tiers, `README.md`
- **What:**
  - `robots.txt` flipped from `Allow: /` to `Disallow: /` on both tiers — search engines should not crawl demo content.
  - `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />` added to every HTML page on both tiers (5 × 2 = 10 pages).
  - Deleted `sitemap.xml` from both tiers (no point listing pages we're telling crawlers to ignore).
  - README updated: `*.vercel.app` URLs replaced with `*.ibithun.com`; added a note about the noindex stance and Vercel deploy hygiene (cache headers, security headers, analytics).
- **Why:** User point — demo content shouldn't compete with the real client site in search results, and shouldn't appear in Google when prospects search the customer's actual brand later. Belt-and-suspenders: meta-robots + robots.txt.
- **How to revert:** `git revert <sha>`. Restores indexability and re-creates the sitemaps.

### Commit `<pending>` — Move build log out of .claude/, fully untrack that dir
- **Date:** 2026-05-01
- **Type:** chore
- **Files touched:** `.claude/BUILD_PROGRESS.md` → `docs/BUILD_PROGRESS.md` (rename), `.gitignore`
- **What:**
  - Moved this file from `.claude/BUILD_PROGRESS.md` to `docs/BUILD_PROGRESS.md`. Git rename detection preserves history.
  - `.gitignore` simplified: the previous `.claude/*` plus `!.claude/BUILD_PROGRESS.md` exception was replaced with a flat `.claude/` so the entire directory is ignored.
- **Why:** Bithun's global rule — codebase must not visibly expose AI tool names. `.claude/` showing in the GitHub file tree violated that. Build log itself is fine to keep (no AI mentions inside), just at a neutral path.
- **How to apply going forward:** new commit log entries continue in `docs/BUILD_PROGRESS.md`. Anything an AI tool wants to leave behind locally goes in `.claude/` and stays gitignored.
- **How to revert:** `git revert <sha>` and `git mv docs/BUILD_PROGRESS.md .claude/BUILD_PROGRESS.md` plus restore the `.gitignore` exception.

### Commit `130d76c` — Pre-skill parity cleanup
- **Date:** 2026-05-02
- **Type:** chore
- **Files touched:** `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/{index,menu,about,gallery}.html`, `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/js/main.js`
- **What:**
  - `.gitignore`: added `_public/` (Nano Banana staging dir, family-wide convention) and `Thumbs.db`.
  - `README.md`: corrected design-tokens table to match actual `:root` (background `#FBF6EC`, both tiers identical palette); dropped false claim that classic carries `videos/` for parity (it does not — premium-only); rephrased the Photography note to drop the explicit "AI-generated" wording per global no-AI-attribution rule.
  - Modal CTA email consolidated from `post@bakeridemo.no` → `post@mollerbakeri.no` across 6 HTML pages and 4 translations entries (NO + EN per tier). One email per customer simplifies fork. Demo-CTA inbox idea moves to a footer link instead.
  - Footer tagline normalized: `menu.html`, `about.html`, `gallery.html` in BOTH tiers were carrying the truncated form (`Surdeigsbrød og bakverk siden 1962.`); now match `index.html`'s full form (`...siden 1962. Bakt for hånd, daglig.`). JS i18n already overrides on premium so only the static fallback drifted.
  - Open Graph + Twitter Card meta block added to `menu.html`, `about.html`, `gallery.html` in both tiers (6 pages — see follow-up commit for the 2 × 404). Each page picks its own banner image so a direct share renders the page-specific preview, not the home hero.
- **Why:** pre-skill parity audit (2026-05-02) flagged these as accidental drift before the prototype gets productised as `moller-bakeri-skill`. Fixing them in the prototype means the per-customer fork procedure inherits the correct shape, instead of every fork having to re-do the same fixes.
- **How to revert:** `git revert 130d76c`. Each change is also reversible by hand from the diff stat.

### Commit `340084a` — Add OG meta to 404 pages for parity
- **Date:** 2026-05-02
- **Type:** chore
- **Files touched:** `demo-bakeri-{classic,premium}/404.html`
- **What:** Added the same OG/Twitter Card block to both 404 pages. `og:image` falls back to `hero-bread.jpg` (no dedicated 404 banner); `og:url` points at the page's own canonical URL.
- **Why:** completeness — every HTML page now carries OG meta. Even with `noindex/nofollow`, a direct share of a 404 URL should preview cleanly rather than render empty.
- **How to revert:** `git revert 340084a`.

## Current state of each tier

### `demo-bakeri-classic/`
- 5 HTML pages, single CSS, single JS
- **Live URL:** https://demo-bakeri-classic.ibithun.com (custom domain via Vercel)
- **i18n:** NO/EN toggle **disabled** (Norwegian-only baseline) — strings preserved in JS for future upsell
- **Animations:** **disabled** — fully static. CSS override block + dedicated `:hover`-killer block at end of style.css nullify all transitions, hover transforms, hover colour shifts, hover bg fills, fade-up reveals, page fade. Click interactions (FAQ accordion, lightbox, Vipps modal, mobile hamburger) remain functional
- **Mobile menu:** 240px right-anchored dropdown card, body-font links, drop shadow. No transform animation
- **Visitor badge:** **commented out** (premium-only feature)
- **Vipps modal trigger:** "Forhåndsbestill" buttons on each menu item — still works (modal show/hide is dialog interaction, not page animation)
- **Menu images:** 18 menu items — sour1/2/3 use today-sourdough/hero-bread/cat-sourdough; sour4/5/6 → menu-01-olive-rosemary/menu-02-buckwheat/menu-03-roll (`.jpeg`); past1/2 → today-croissant/cat-pastry; past3/4/5/6 → menu-04-pain-chocolat/menu-05-kanelsnurr/today-cardamom/menu-06-eplekrans (`.jpeg`); cake1 → cat-cake; cake2/3/4/5/6 → menu-07-truffle-cake/menu-08-lemon-pistasj/menu-09-bringebær/menu-10-brownie/menu-11-lemon-tart (`.jpeg`)
- **Categories (homepage):** 4 cards — Surdeigsbrød, Bakverk, Kaker, Kafé & disk. Heading: "Alt under samme tak". Grid: 4-col desktop / 2-col tablet / 1-col mobile
- **Gallery:** 3 explicit `.gallery-col` wrappers (8 / 7 / 8 split, items distributed by `nth-child` modulo 3). Same layout as premium but full colour, no animation
- **About photo grid:** `230px / 230px / 540px` rows, default `object-position: center 28%` to keep faces visible, storefront tile uses `object-fit: contain` to avoid cropping
- **Mobile focal point classes:** `.focal-upper` (10%), `.focal-lower` (55%), `.focal-low` (70%), `.focal-right` (65% x), `.bg-focal-right`; applied per-image in HTML. Default `object-position: center 50%`
- **Deploy:** `vercel.json` with 1y immutable cache for `/assets/*`, 1d for css/js, security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- **Robots:** `Disallow: /` + `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` on every page (demo-stance, no SEO competition with future real client site)
- **LOCKED** — no further changes planned for classic tier

### `demo-bakeri-premium/`
- Same 5 HTML pages + signature features layered into `index.html`
- **Live URL:** https://demo-bakeri-premium.ibithun.com (custom domain via Vercel)
- **i18n:** NO/EN toggle **active** (premium feature)
- **Animations:** classic baseline (kept) + croissant bobs, counter count-up, timeline ring-pulse + progress fill, per-icon timeline float, ambient hero video, gallery column parallax drift
- **Nav hover:** per-link warm-palette text-shadow glow (no underline). Hjem `#B8842B` → Meny `#C8704F` → Om oss `#D4A24A` → Galleri `#A8454F`
- **Mobile menu:** 240px liquid-glass floating card (`rgba(251,246,236,0.40)` + `blur(30px) saturate(180%)` backdrop filter), inset top-edge highlight, anchored top-right with 0.85rem margin, 80px from top
- **Visitor badge:** rendered in footer (premium feature)
- **Hero video:** `assets/videos/hero-bread.mp4` (loaded with JPG poster fallback)
- **Categories (homepage):** 4 cards — same as classic + float animation. Pause-on-hover pattern (back-side amber ring, neighbours keep bobbing)
- **Pause-on-hover pattern (rameezscripts):** applied to `.bake-card`, `.categories-grid .category-card`, `.menu-grid .menu-item` — hover pauses *that* card's float and adds an amber ring (`box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px rgba(184,132,43,0.50), 0 0 38px rgba(225,190,130,0.50), 0 14px 38px rgba(184,132,43,0.22)`). Critical: `:hover` must source-order *after* the `:nth-child` `animation:` shorthand or the shorthand resets `animation-play-state` to running. Uses `!important` for safety.
- **Menu / mobile-cropping:** same image set + focal-point classes as classic
- **Gallery:** 3 explicit `.gallery-col` wrappers (8 / 7 / 8 split, identical to classic). Default `filter: grayscale(100%)`. Hover/touch reveals full colour + `scale(1.04)` + `var(--color-accent-light)` border highlight on `::after`. Each column drifts independently — col 1 down 9s, col 2 up 9s 0.4s delay, col 3 down 9s 0.8s delay
- **About photo grid:** identical to classic (`230 / 230 / 540`, `object-fit: contain` on storefront)
- **Floating cards:** `.bake-card` (Dagens bakst) — 3 cards, durations 4.2/5.1/3.8s with 0.9/1.0/1.1s delays. `.categories-grid .category-card` (Vårt utvalg) — 4 cards, 4.7/5.5/4.1/5.0s with 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8s delays. `.menu-grid .menu-item` — 18 cards on a 6-pattern `nth-child(6n+1..6)` cycle, 4.1–5.7s × 0.8–1.8s delays. Pure `translateY`, GPU-composite only. `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback included
- **Deploy:** identical `vercel.json` config to classic
- **Robots:** identical noindex/nofollow stance — demo content excluded from search
- **LOCKED** — no further changes planned for premium tier
